# bruther
An exercise in decentralized hacking

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore building a dsitribited application.

The project will take advantage of NAT Tunneling provided by localTunnel
https://localtunnel.github.io/www/

Using NAT tunneling peer nodes will communicate.

There are two target applications:
1) Messaging
Allow the users to send messages to each other.
If a user is off-line that users messages will be stored by other nodes and forwarded when the user is next on-line.

2) Reliable shared file storage
Like Drop-box except that the web storage will be "donated" by peers

The idea is to base these two applications on some underlaying technolgies from peer to peer sharing networks
